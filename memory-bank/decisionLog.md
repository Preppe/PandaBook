# Decision Log

[2025-04-12 19:23:21] - Aligned and synchronized all backend entities (Book, Audio, Chapter, User, etc.) with new TypeScript interfaces in the frontend for full structural and type consistency.  
- Created: `frontend/src/lib/models/Book.ts`, `Audio.ts`, `Chapter.ts`, `User.ts`
- Updated API config to import and use these models.
- Deprecated legacy frontend models in favor of unified interfaces.
- Ensured all fields, types, and relationships match backend entities.
